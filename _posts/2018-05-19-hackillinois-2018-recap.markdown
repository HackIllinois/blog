This February, HackIllinois welcomed over 1000 students to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for a developement-filled weekend where students from across the Midwest and the country gathered to make contributions to open source projects. Over the course of just 36 hours, attendees made signifigant contributions, making over [94 submissions](https://hackillinois-2018.devpost.com/submissions) by the end!

With the focus on open source at HackIllinois, attendees spent the weekend learning about and building out new open source features and tools that tackled issues in many different fields. HackIllinois kicked off with panels on Web/Data and Systems/Miscellaneous after the Opening Ceremony. Mentors presented some of the projects students could join, after which students joined groups they were interested in.

Attendees worked late into the night starting on their projects: mentors taught students how to set up their environments and basics of the project and how to make contributions.

HackIllinois also featured a wide array of talks and workshops. There were many presentations on interesting techical topics such as machine learning and virtual reality, as well as sessions focused specifically on open source, such as the Women in Open Source panel. Some attendees also prepared short lightning talks on a variety of diverse topics, from networking to memes.

There were also some great keynotes from members of the open source community. Travis Oliphant, the creator of NumPy and SciPy and the CEO of Anaconda, spoke about open source and changes in data science. Vijay Patel, a software engineer at Google, discussed his work on gRPC and other open source projects in his time at Google. Katy Huff, an associate professor at Illinois, and Steve Klabnik, a member of the Rust core team, both also spoke about their experiences in open source.

Throughout the weekend, there were all sorts of activities to take a break from coding. Our sponsors set out swag at their tables and games in their lounges.

Tons of attendees had fun playing Nerf at the Kenney Gym on Saturday. As is tradition, the last game was a Hackillinois staff versus sponsor round.

Sunday morning brought the end of hacking, and groups wrapped up their contributions and documented their work on Devpost in preparation for demos. Some therapy dogs visited and brought a smile to many a face.

By the end, there were tons of excitement in the air as judges went around and checked out the contributions made. For open source contributors all around, there was much learned and created.
