This year, HackIllinois brought back the only open source college hackathon in the country. Our primary goal was to support student developers in giving back to the open-source community. 

Many of the hackers at the event had the opportunity to work with mentors from industry and the open source community. One of our most successful projects from a group of hackers working with a mentor was Puppeteer to Istanbul.

## Puppeteer to Istanbul

At HackIllinois this year, Benjamin Coe, from NPM, worked with Viktor KÃ¶ves, Robert Altman, Ashwin Gokhale, Mustafa Musabeyli, and Tony An to create the project Puppeteer to Istanbul. Istanbul is a widely used JavaScript code coverage tool that gives a web visualization of test cases for developers, and Puppeteer is a Node API that allows developers to control headless Chrome and Chromium. Puppeteer to Istanbul is a tool that converts code coverage reports from Puppeteer to a format readable by Istanbul.
