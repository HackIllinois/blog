In our first mentor spotlight this year, we talk with Katharine Hyatt, who mentored at HackIllinois 2019. (add fluff)

### Tell us about yourself. What is your background and what do you do now? 
Hello! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics at the Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics). My day-to-day job involves working with Computational Physics, which is what I have been pursuing since Graduate School. I work with the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) for writing code for research purposes and have also been an Open Source contributor to Julia since 2015.

For Julia, I usually work on writing and maintaining libraries to add high-level features. Some things that I have worked in in the past are wrappers for Video Libraries, and libraries for Linear Algebra and Random Number Generation, all of which interface with main Julia API. 

### How did you get started in tech? 
I had no programming experience before I started my undergraduate degree in Physics. In my first year, I took a required class called Introduction to Computational Physics, where I first learned C++. I was pretty good at it and went on to work with my professor from this class as an Undergraduate Research Intern later in my college career. You could say I went from Freshman with no idea about Computer Science to mentoring students at HackIllinois. 

### What are some of the projects you are working on currently?
I primarily work with the Julia ecosystem, with GPU packages more specifically. I think the Julia ecosystem is a viable choice for this as it offers native support for CUDA kernels. I'm currently working on a new sort of [module that deals with High Dimensional Tensors](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl). We conducted supporting research in the context of Multi-Dimensional Linear Algebra, and I'm happy to say that project is now almost complete and will be useful in fields such as Machine Learning. 

### What is open source/FOSS to you? 
Open Source holds a lot of significance for me, both personally and professionally. In my industry, there has been a push for open source elements recently to minimize duplication of effort. There might be situations where different groups are solving the same problem but still not getting the same answer legibly. Utilizing open source resources in such situations avoids teams working to reinvent the wheel and also makes it easy to identify problems during code audits.

For me, open source is also a way to give back to the community. What is truly inspiring is that something small that a contribution by a single person has the potential to pay big dividends for the community at large. 
    
### Why do you contribute to open source? 
When working on algorithm development, my team and I can go months without knowing whether the project is going to work or not as there are a lot of moving parts. In such times, merging a pull request is something to fall back on as it is somewhat soothing for me to go back home and add two lines to GitHub and seeing everything working.

Working on open source projects has also professionally beneficial for me. My peers and other industry professionals have come to recognize me as the "Julia person". My work has also led me to receive invitations to speak at conferences that are not just focussed on Physics and helped me explore fields broader than my immediate research interests. Having experience with open source projects also makes it easier for me to find professional endeavors in the Computer Science industry if I decide to explore areas outside of academia.

### What about the open source community, and in particular Julia, drew you to being an active part of it? 
As I mentioned earlier, the first language I learned was C++, and I only started using Julia in Graduate School. The selling point of Julia is that it offers the ease of use of Python with the speed of C++. What attracted me was the very welcoming and helpful community. I remember that when I first started, I didn't have a lot of git skills. One time I had to use rebase, but I had no experience in using it. That's when members from the community came forward to help me with git and also with getting my code across that production line, which was very assuring. That experience was definitely something that stuck with me and made me want to be part of this wonderful community. 

### What was your first interaction/impression of open source and how has your involvement in open source evolved over time? 
I've been using Julia since Graduate School. I first started contributing by writing tests and fixing edge cases in my free time, usually when waiting for simulations to finish running. My first Julia PR was on January 2nd, 2015, where I added some tests to Reduce.jl. At the time, the language was not as mature as it is today, and I occasionally encountered little bugs and missing features. 

There have been some pretty noticible changes as the Julia community has grown in the past few years. Today I hear comments like, "This stuff is so reliable" or "This never breaks", which was unheard of in the past. 

I have also grown with the community, and have personally gained a lot of knowledge of experience. Today I have the 9th most commits to the language, and my experience has changed my role in the community in different ways. Now contributers sometimes ask me to review and merge PRs, which can be a little inconvenient when I have other stuff going. Now contributors sometimes ask me to review and merge PRs, which can be a little inconvenient when I have other stuff going. This is very different from my early days when I could do things at my own pace. I'm no longer also the only woman in the Julia community, and so I don't have to play the role of community manager whenever people wanted the opinion of women in Julia. 

1. What do you recommend to beginners interested in Open Source? 

- People who’re just getting into Open Source can sometimes struggle with finding a project to work on 
    - Some existing projects can be so large and complex are so big and so complex that it’s hard to find a first issue to work on due to the many interlocking parts 
        - If someone is not already familiar with how Firefox works, they might probably won’t know how to begin working 

    - Julia also has some proof of concept packages that can be considered abandonware 
    - It’s advisable to find a package that’s not a base project or has only a few regular contributors.  
        - If a project has people actively working on it, they definitely need some help - writing tests or adding docs 
        - This is not to discourage people from being ambitious but starting where somebody can help you is a good path to go on 

  

1. What are you most excited about in technology and open source? 

- One thing that’s really nice is that people are becoming more flexible with languages -&gt; these days nobody has to start a religious argument about which language/tools are better than others 
    - Jupyter 
    - Python  
    - Pydata 

- At the same time we have to be prepared to deal with community management issues that are common to most growing communities 
    - Prevent contributors from burning out 
    - Continue to add contributors 
    - Take inspiration from other communities 

  

1. What was your experience like, as a mentor at HackIllinois? 

- “Really liked my time at HackIllinois” 
- My team freshman/inexperienced programmers who had never met each other before. Even so, they were able to make a PR by the end together which ended up getting merged. 
    - Empirically, it’s possible to grab unknown people and succeed, which is usually hard to do alone 
    - As the weekend progress they didn’t really need me and I just cheered them on 
    - They continued to work on the project for a while but it dropped off gradually 

  

Katie will ask the person who they contributed to if they are interested in mentoring at 2020

  

1. What do you seek the most out of hackathons? 

- Not been to a lot of hackathons 
    - Goes to JuliaCON almost every year, which is less structured without a competition or prizes at the end. There’s both good and bad things about this approach. 

- Really likes the Open Source focus are Hackillinois that brings people to a stage where they get a pull request opened 
- Not been to many so does not want to draw an opinion 
  
  

1. What are you looking forward to next year? 

- Really happy with the 2019 event -&gt; had a really good experience and looking forward to more of the same 
- Only thing that she really needs is sleep, power, and enthusiastic students - which were all readily available (:D)
