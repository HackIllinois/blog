In our first mentor spotlight this year, we talk with Katharine Hyatt, who mentored at HackIllinois 2019. (add fluff)

### Tell us about yourself. What is your background and what do you do now? 
Hello! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics at the Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics). My day-to-day job involves working with Computational Physics, which is what I have been pursuing since Graduate School. I work with the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) for writing code for research purposes and have also been an Open Source contributor to Julia since 2015.

For Julia, I usually work on writing and maintaining libraries to add high-level features. Some things that I have worked in in the past are wrappers for Video Libraries, and libraries for Linear Algebra and Random Number Generation, all of which interface with main Julia API. 

### How did you get started in tech? 
I had no programming experience before I started my undergraduate degree in Physics. In my first year, I took a required class called Introduction to Computational Physics, where I first learned C++. I was pretty good at it and went on to work with my professor from this class as an Undergraduate Research Intern later in my college career. You could say I went from Freshman with no idea about Computer Science to mentoring students at HackIllinois. 

### What are some of the projects you are working on currently?
I primarily work with the Julia ecosystem, with GPU packages more specifically. I think the Julia ecosystem is a viable choice for this as it offers native support for CUDA kernels. I'm currently working on a new sort of [module that deals with High Dimensional Tensors](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl). We conducted supporting research in the context of Multi-Dimensional Linear Algebra, and I'm happy to say that project is now almost complete and will be useful in fields such as Machine Learning. 

### What is open source/FOSS to you? 
Open Source holds a lot of significance for me, both personally and professionally. In my industry there has been a push for Open Source elements recently to minimize duplication of effort. Ther might be situations where there are 4-5 different groups solving the same problem but still not getting the same answer in a legible way. Utilizing Open Source resources in such situations avoids pe And if there is a need to perform an audit to identify the problem -&gt; can’t figure out bugs in a closed source library 

- For her personally: OSS is a way to give back to the community 
    - Started by making Linear Algebra functionality better 
    - Something small that you contribute can pay big dividends for the community at large 

  

    1. What about the OS community drew you to being an active part of it? 
        1. Community was really welcoming 
            1. Not a lot git skills -&gt; no experience with rebase 
            2. Strong community (always happy to help)  -&gt; people helped with rebase 
            3. Got it across prod line 

  1. What drew you to Julia? 

- First language was C++ 
- Started Julia in Grad school 
    - "Ease of use of Python and speed of C++" 
    - Community was really welcoming 
        - Not a lot git skills -&gt; no experience with rebase 
        - Strong community (always happy to help)  -&gt; people helped with rebase 
        - Got it across prod line

1. Why do you contribute to open source? 

- When working on algorithm development, people can go months without knowing whether the project is going to work or not as there are a lot of moving parts 
    - Soothing for her to back home and add 2 lines to github and seeing everything works and then merge pr 
    - Something to fall back on 

- Also professionally useful (not everybody can have this experience) 
    - Peers and professionals recognize her as the “Julia person” 
    - Receive invitations to speak at conferences that are not just Physics focussed 
    - Also makes it easier for her to find an industry job if she ever decides to move on from academia 

  

1. What was your first interaction/impression of open source and how has your involvement in open source evolved over time? 

- First Interaction 
    - First Julia PR was on Jan 2nd 2015 (really bored over break?)  
        - Added tests to Reduce.jl 

    - Had to use git rebase 
        - Tim H. walked her through rebasing which was very reassuring (again, helpful community) 
      
      - Julia was not as mature when she started using it 
        - Encountered little bugs and missing features 

- Started with writing tests and fixing edge cases 
    - Started contributing in her free time when waiting for simulations to run 
    - Using Julia since Grad School 
    - 9th most commits all-time (!)
  
- Evolution: As the Julia community has grown, there have been some pretty noticeable changes 
    - For her 
        - Now people tag her to review PRs while when she started she could just do things at her own pace 
        - Now people ask her to merge PRs when she might have other stuff going on 
        - Hears comments like “this stuff is so reliable”, or “this never breaks”; it never used to be like that 

    - Community  
        - No longer the only women in Julia (yay!)  
        - Used to be the one people came to when they wanted opinion of women in Julia -&gt; doesn’t have to do community manager role anymore 

  

1. What do you recommend to beginners interested in Open Source? 

- People who’re just getting into Open Source can sometimes struggle with finding a project to work on 
    - Some existing projects can be so large and complex are so big and so complex that it’s hard to find a first issue to work on due to the many interlocking parts 
        - If someone is not already familiar with how Firefox works, they might probably won’t know how to begin working 

    - Julia also has some proof of concept packages that can be considered abandonware 
    - It’s advisable to find a package that’s not a base project or has only a few regular contributors.  
        - If a project has people actively working on it, they definitely need some help - writing tests or adding docs 
        - This is not to discourage people from being ambitious but starting where somebody can help you is a good path to go on 

  

1. What are you most excited about in technology and open source? 

- One thing that’s really nice is that people are becoming more flexible with languages -&gt; these days nobody has to start a religious argument about which language/tools are better than others 
    - Jupyter 
    - Python  
    - Pydata 

- At the same time we have to be prepared to deal with community management issues that are common to most growing communities 
    - Prevent contributors from burning out 
    - Continue to add contributors 
    - Take inspiration from other communities 

  

1. What was your experience like, as a mentor at HackIllinois? 

- “Really liked my time at HackIllinois” 
- My team freshman/inexperienced programmers who had never met each other before. Even so, they were able to make a PR by the end together which ended up getting merged. 
    - Empirically, it’s possible to grab unknown people and succeed, which is usually hard to do alone 
    - As the weekend progress they didn’t really need me and I just cheered them on 
    - They continued to work on the project for a while but it dropped off gradually 

  

Katie will ask the person who they contributed to if they are interested in mentoring at 2020

  

1. What do you seek the most out of hackathons? 

- Not been to a lot of hackathons 
    - Goes to JuliaCON almost every year, which is less structured without a competition or prizes at the end. There’s both good and bad things about this approach. 

- Really likes the Open Source focus are Hackillinois that brings people to a stage where they get a pull request opened 
- Not been to many so does not want to draw an opinion 
  
  

1. What are you looking forward to next year? 

- Really happy with the 2019 event -&gt; had a really good experience and looking forward to more of the same 
- Only thing that she really needs is sleep, power, and enthusiastic students - which were all readily available (:D)
