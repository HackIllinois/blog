Open Source carried a huge presence at HackIllinois 2018. This year, we had over [40 mentors](https://2018.hackillinois.org/mentors) and 25 sponsors at HackIllinois, and everyone came eager to contribute to the open source community! The goal of HackIllinois has transitioned in recent years to connect with the developer community; to encourage students and hackers from all over the country to contribute to the tools they use every day. HackIllinois 2018 was a giant step towards fulfilling this vision.

# Mentors

Open source contributions at HackIllinois would not be possible without the many amazing mentors that attended the event this year. Mentorship is essential to the HackIllinois experience; these experienced open source contributors and engineers help students get the ball rolling on contributing to open source. 

To initially introduce students to the mentors, we held panels regarding Web/Data and Systems so students could come hear about the fields they were interested in. Afterward, mentors briefly described their projects and students had a chance to discuss with mentors and join their teams.

Afterward, hacking began! Students began learning the ropes of open source and finding issues to solve. Many mentors had tagged issues for HackIllinois beforehand, and were prepared to guide students through the initially intimidating process of understanding a codebase and improving it.

Last year, hacker Trent Spice worked with the Rust team and [won the Long Con prize](https://blog.hackillinois.org/spotlight/2017/09/29/open-source-at-hackillinois-rust-cookbook.html) for HackIllinois 2017. This year, he came back with other students from IUPUI and continued to work on Rust with mentors Steve Klabnik and Ashley Williams. HackIllinois aims to build these long term relationships between students and the open source community, and we're super glad that projects like [Rust Cookbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-cookbook) and [Rustbridge](https://github.com/rustbridge) are still being contributed to and built on.

# Projects

Tons of open source projects found themselves welcoming new contributors at HackIllinois. We had representatives from large open source projects such as [Apache Mesos](https://github.com/apache/mesos), [NPM](https://github.com/npm/npm), [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust), [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda), [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew), and [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper). These were great because students and mentors could work together to contribute to some of the tools they use everyday.

HackIllinois was home to lots of smaller, growing open source projects, too, like [OpenTreeMap](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-core), [NodeSchool](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io) and [PrairieLearn](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn). We love these open source projects because they get great opportunities for growth at HackIllinois. In fact, mentor Michael Maurizi told me that he and his team solved every issue that he had set aside for HackIllinois 2018!

HackIllinois did not limit students to just contributing to open source, though. Many students developed their own open source projects to give back to the community with their own new ideas. One project, [Puppeteer To Istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/puppeteer-to-istanbul) even has 69 stars on Github and was mentioned in a talk at GoogleIO! And it was born right here at HackIllinois.

# Sponsors

Sponsors at HackIllinois had a great presence in Open Source as well! Companies had tons of opportunities to get involved with hackers on their projects. Nearly all companies brought mentors that worked with students on contributing and creating open source projects. Even companies that didn't have their own open source projects were able to work with students, because the mentors that came had experience working on large scale projects and were able to contribute alongside students. The one-on-one attention and guidance that these mentors offered was integral to many of the projects that won prizes at HackIllinois.

Companies also had the option to interact with hackers in many other ways too. Some companies sponsored a prize and were able to present it to the project of their choice at the end of the event, and some companies even had personalized lounges for hackers to work in!
