This February, HackIllinois welcomed over a thousand students to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for an excitement-packed weekend to develop open-source projects.

HackIllinois 2018 kicked off Friday afternoon, with students lining up for registration and to chat with sponsors at the company expo. After everyone filled up on dinner from Panda Express and Kohinoor, they heard opening remarks from the Opening Ceremony. Attendees then broke out into two panels based on their interests: Web & Data and Systems where open-source mentors spoke about their projects and the open-source community in general.

Attendees, however, weren't just at HackIllinois to hear about open source. As the panels concluded, attendees formed into groups via the project matching sessions to work on open-source projects -- be it with open-source projects to improve popular open-source projects such as Rust and Freenode.

Groups worked on their projects throughout the weekend with the goal of starting meaningful contributions to their open-source projects. As attendees worked with their mentors to learn the ups and downs of their projects and strode to make changes and submit pull requests, along the way they learned about new technologies at workshops ranging from virtual reality to machine learning, as well as lightning talks from fellow students about such disparate topics as memes and documentation.

HackIllinois 2018 also featured keynotes from Katy Huff, Illinois professor in NPRE; Steve Klabnik, Rust; Vijay Pai, Google; and Travis Oliphant, numpy/scipy/anaconda; who spoke about powerful ideas in the open-source community.

Still, it wasn't all about pure development. Sppnsors provided plenty of fun activities to take a break, including video games and puzzles in their lounges, for instance. Many attendees also stepped out for fun games of nerf or to play with the therapy dogs.

As the hacking deadline approached Sunday morning, groups worked hard to finish up and put on the final touches. Groups presented their open-source contributions to our judges and everyone else in attendence.

After the closing ceremony, students piled onto buses back to Chicago, Indiana, Michigan, and even Georgia and Florida! And with that, HackIllinois 2018 came to a close.
