For the HackIllinois team, open source never stops. This past Tuesday, we continued our work in open source through an open source HackNight. HackNights are an opportunity for student developers at UIUC to work on open source projects with peers, professors, and lead engineers. For our first HackNight, we invited the developers of the [Illinois Queue](https://github.com/illinois/queue) team to teach and work with students to improve the Queue - one of Illinois's latest open source projects. The Queue is a campus wide tool used by classes to keep track of students waiting in line for office hours.

Nathan Walters, Genna Helsel, and Professor Wade Fagen Ulmschneider from the Queue development team started off the night by giving a short tutorial on how to get started, and then it was off to the races as the students at the HackNight started claiming issues and making PRs. After just 2 hours of work, there were [5 Pull Requests](https://github.com/illinois/queue/pulls) made and [4 new Issues](https://github.com/illinois/queue/issues) logged for the project!

Our goal with our HackNights is to encourage continuous open source contribution throughout the year - especially on projects that are relevant to the community. As development on the queue continues, we hope to encourage contribution to more projects in the open source community. Of course, this was the first of many HackNights and just a start for the larger community of Illinois Open Source. Stay tuned for more updates and, as always, keep on contributing!
