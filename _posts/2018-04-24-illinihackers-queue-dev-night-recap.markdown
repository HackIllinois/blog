For the HackIllinois team, open source never stops. This Tuesday we brought back our open source HackNights. HackNights are an opportunity for students on the UIUC campus to work on open source projects with peers and professors. For our first HackNight, we invited the Illinois Queue team to teach and work with students to improve the Queue. The Queue is a campus wide open source projects used by classes to keep track of students waiting in line for office hours. Nathan Walters, Genna Helsel, and Professor Wade Fagen Ulmschneider from the Queue development team started off the night by giving a short tutorial on how to get started, and then the 20 students who came began contributing to the project. After 2 productive hours of work, there were 5 Pull Requests made and 4 new Issues logged for the project. This was the first of many HackNights and future open source contributions. Stay tuned for more updates and keep on contributing.
