Even though school has just begun, planning for HackIllinois 2019 is already well under way, and our team would love to offer you an inside look at some of our motivations and guiding principles.

# Something Old

We've already explored the event last year in a couple retrospectives, so here we'll focus on how what we did last year at HackIllinois 2018 all applies to this year. First and foremost, we've been engaging mentors from last year to get their takes on their weekend on campus back in February: what they liked and what they would like changed. Based on the feedback we've received so far, this year we're focusing on providing more guidance for mentors so they can be best prepared for what to expect at HackIllinois. We'll also be working on resources for students to look toward to learn about open source, as well as pre-event tools that will provide suggestions and descriptions for mentors and their projects. We expect these changes to enhance the experience at HackIllinois for both mentors and students.

We're excited to have had so many talented mentors at HackIllinois. Our mentors are the core of the HackIllinois experience, tons of fun to host, and exceptionally talented contributors in their fields. If you didn't get to engage with the mentors at the event, we hope to make this opportunity more central to the participant experience in the future.

HackIllinois 2018 also saw many engaging workshops and lightning talks, teaching everything from such technical content as Unity development all the way to goofy presentations on making memes. Sponsors and students always do a great job in offering up knowledge on a range of topics that makes HackIllinois about much more than the projects in and of themselves. Our sponsors are some of the biggest, best, and most cutting-edge players in the tech industry, and the value they provide to the event and the attendees cannot be overstated. Being able to take a break from your project is something all of our attendees should feel comfortable doing, and we're continuting to work with sponsors to create fun and exciting activities for participants this year.

# Something New

We're officially less than seven months away from check in, but who's counting? HackIllinois 2019 will be the sixth time Illinois students organize what has become the premier open source event that brings together students and mentors. As HackIllinois has changed over time, so has our mission. This year, HackIllinois is about much more than individual projects -- this year, it's about bringing it all together.

>**_HackIllinois aims to create an environment conducive to education, collaboration, and mentorship within the open source community._**

As HackIllinois continues to grow, we are _creating an enviroment_  that is more than the sum of all its parts. We plan to bringing together over 1000 students, from Illinois and over a dozen other universities, and amazing mentors so that everyone can have an incredible experience throughout the weekend that builds off the excitement of having dozens of open source projects as well as the interaction amongst all the participants.

For many of these participants, HackIllinois is their first deep dive into open source. HackIllinois provides an opportunity to look at open source throught he lens of an existing project, and the event _educates_ students about important considerations and tools central to open source. HackIllinois also fosters _collaboration_: students and mentors alike work toward learning more about open source. These open source contributions at HackIllinois are long-term: they give back to the community by their very nature, rather than being an amalgamation of APIs hurridly strewn together in the hopes of a prize. The _mentorship_ at HackIllinois is also top-notch, with open source contributors working closely with students throughout the event in hands-on learning about what contributing to open source looks like.

The focus this year follows the trail that has been blazed by HackIllinois in years past, and we want to assert our post as an event that serves _the open source community_. We fully believe that our event betters the open source community: by bringing in students as new contributors, continuing development on projects we believe in, and showcasing the talent pool that we have to offer, HackIllinois brings attention and a starting off point for students who might not be aware of open source or are interested in getting involved but don't know where to start.

Furthermore, this year we want to make HackIllinois even more **exciting**. We are putting as much emphasis as we can on making this event more than just 36 hours of coding: simply writing code that happens to be shared with everyone is not enough at HackIllinois 2019. It will be the immersive experience of teamwork, guidance, and excitement that participants have come to expect out of our staff. We will run interactive workshops, present lively mini-events, and host top industry talent for our weekend in February. The open source experience will be distinctive: exciting to both the open source gurus and those who have not yet explored this region of the technology world.

# Something Borrowed

We are always open to feedback and new ideas. If you have participated in our event or any hackathon, conference, get-together, Urbana Sweetcorn Festival: **anything** where you found a fun or engaging project, activity, or meal, please do not hesitate to suggest it to us! We are still deep in the development phase of the event and love to hear from you all, so reach out to us! Working together and getting advice from informed individuals is our style.

There are some pilot ideas we will be exploring over the following months as planning continues, so let us know on contact@hackillinois.org if you have suggestions, feedback, or just want to share your experiences with us. We're always happy to hear from you! We will continue to make more announcements here on our blog and on our social media accounts.

Furthermore, we will be attending conferences and hackathons alike to get a good sense of what is currently being developed in the world around us. If you see somebody in a HackIllinois staff shirt, please engage with us! We genuinely enjoy having conversations with our attendees, and it may be a much easier forum to discuss and get ideas across than over an email. Additionally, if you are an Illinois student who would like to get involved in this process and join our team, look out for the HackIllinois meetings in the fall to learn about how to get involved, so stay tuned :-).

# Something Blue

Our team is currently hard at work incorporating the color blue into the design of [HackIllinois 2019](https://hackillinois.org).
