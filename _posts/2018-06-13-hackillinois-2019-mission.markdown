Even though it's only June, planning for HackIllinois 2019 is already well under way, and our Summer Team would love to offer you an inside look at some of our motivations and guiding principles.

# Something Old

The blog has already explored the event last year in a few retrospective pieces, but here we will begin focusing on how it all applies to next year. We are currently in the process of engaging mentors from last year to get their take on their weekend on campus: what they liked and what they would like changed. These mentors are the heart of our hacker experience, tons of fun to host, and exceptionally talented contributors in their field. If you didn't get to engage with the mentors at the event, we hope to make this opportunity more central to the hacker experience this year.

HackIllinois 2018 also saw many engaging workshops and lightning talks, teaching everything from Unity development to making memes. Our sponsors and students always do a great job in offering supplemental knowledge and tools that you may not otherwise have had the opportunity to experience. Our sponsors are some of the biggest, best, and most cutting-edge players in the tech industry, and the value they provide to the event and the attendees cannot be overstated. Being able to take a break from your project is something all of our attendees should take advantage of, and we'll continue to develop these aspects of the event for the years to come.

# Something New

There are only 8 months, 2 days, and 4 hours until check-in, but who's counting? HackIllinois 2019 will be the sixth time Illinois students organize what has become the premier open source event available to undergraduates. While writing this statement, we wanted to explore and emphasize the varied roles that HackIllinois takes on. Our mission this year:

>**To create an environment conducive to education, collaboration, and mentorship within the Open Source Community**

We _create an enviroment_  in that our event is not defined by a simple "code for a prize" model. We plan to pack the entire event with content for attendees, from Illinois and over a dozen other universities, so that they can have a unique experience throughout the weekend. HackIllinois carries development, social, and networking opportunities, and these establish the three pillars -- _education, collaboration, and mentorship_ -- of our event. The theme this year follows the trail that has been blazed by our past directors and staff, but we wanted to assert our post _within the Open Source community_. We fully believe that our event betters the Open Source Community: by bringing together new students, continuing development on projects we believe in, and showcasing the talent pool that we have to offer.

More specifically, thie year we want to make HackIllinois even more _exciting_. We are putting as much emphasis as we can on making this event more than 36 hours of coding; simply learning about open source is not enough at HackIllinois 2019. It will be the immersive experience of teamwork, guidance, and excitement that hackers have come to expect out of our staff. We will run interactive workshops, present lively mini-events, and host top industry talent for HackIllinois 2019. The Open Source experience will be a cut above that of the past: exciting to both the OSS gurus and those who have not yet explored this region of the technology world.

# Something Borrowed

We are always open to feedback and new ideas. If you have participated in our event or any hackathon, conference, get-together, Urbana Sweetcorn Festival, or ANYTHING where you found a fun or engaging project, activity, or meal, do not hesitate to suggest it to us. We are still in the brainstorming phases for the event and love to hear from you all, so reach out to us! Working together and getting advice from informed individuals is our style. #(OUR HASHTAG HERE)

There are some pilot ideas we will be exploring over the following months as planning continues, so let us know on contact@hackillinois.org if you have suggestions, feedback, or just want to share your experiences with us. We're always happy to hear from you! We will continue to make more announcements on our blog, right here, and on our social media.

Likewise, we will be attending conferences and hackathons alike to get a good sense of what is currently being developed in the world around us. If you see somebody in a HackIllinois staff shirt, please engage with us! We genuinely enjoy having conversations with our attendees, and it may be a much easier forum to discuss and get ideas across than over an email. Additionally, if you are (or will soon become) an Illinois student who'd like to get involved in this process and join our team, we will make a call for staff applications in the fall, so stay tuned :).

# Something Blue

Our team is currently hard at work incorporating the color blue into the design of HackIllinois 2019.
