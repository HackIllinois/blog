Even though it is only June, our HackIllinois Summer team is already well underway in planning the event for next February! We have been exploring tons of new possibilities for what the future of our yearly gathering will look like, and fine-tuning the things that did not go as well last year.


# Something Old:

If you have not already gotten an email, we would love to [hear your feedback](link feedback form here) from HackIllinois 2018! We are currently in the process of engaging our mentors from last year to get their take of the weekend: what they liked and what they would like changed. These mentors are at the heart of our hacker experience, tons of fun to have on campus, and exceptionally talented contributors in their field. If you didn’t get to engage with them at last year’s event, we did not do our jobs properly.

2018 also saw some very engaging workshops and lightning talks, teaching everything from Unity development to making memes. Our sponsors and students always do a great job in offering supplemental knowledge and tools that you would not otherwise have the opportunity to experience. Being able to take a break from your project is something all of our attendees should feel comfortable doing, and we’ll continue to develop these events for the years to come.


# Something New:

There is only 8 months, 7 days, and 6 hours until check-in, but who’s counting? HackIllinois 2019 will be the 6th time Illinois students organize what has become the premier open source event available to undergraduates. We have established our mission this year:

_To create an environment conducive to education, collaboration, and mentorship within the Open Source community_

This year, we are putting as much emphasis as we can on making this event more than 36 hours of coding. Learning about open source is not enough, 2019 will be the immersive experience of teamwork, guidance, and excitement that hackers have come to expect out of our staff. We will run interactive workshops, present lively mini-events, and host top industry talent for our weekend in February.

We will continue to make more announcements on our blog, right here, and with our social media accounts:


## Something Borrowed:

We are always open to feedback and new ideas. If you have participated in our event or any hackathon, conference, get-together, Urbana corn festival, ANYTHING where you found a fun or engaging project, activity, or meal, do not hesitate to suggest it to us. We are still in the brainstorming phases for the event and love to hear from you all, so reach out to us! Working together and getting advice from informed individuals is our style. #(OUR HASHTAG HERE)

Let us know on contact@hackillinois.org if you have suggestions, feedback, or just want to share your experiences with us, we’re always happy to hear from you!


## Something Blue:

Our team is currently hard at work incorporating blue into HackIllinois 2019.
